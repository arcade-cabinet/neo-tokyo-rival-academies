# Modular Assembly System

**Updated**: January 27, 2026

**Purpose**: Define reusable building blocks for rooftop scenes.

## Core Modules

- **Platforms**: base rooftop tiles, stairs, ramps
- **Connectors**: bridges, ladders, catwalks
- **Shelters**: tarp huts, container rooms, scaffold tents
- **Infrastructure**: vents, tanks, solar arrays, antennas
- **Waterline**: docks, skiffs, ferries, crane barges

## Assembly Rules

- **Height safety**: no drops without railings or hazard marking.
- **Traversal clarity**: paths must read at a glance.
- **Faction styling**: color and prop sets swap by Kurenai/Azure.
