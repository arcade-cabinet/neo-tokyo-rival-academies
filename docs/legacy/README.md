# Legacy Documentation (Reference Only)

**Purpose**: Preserve historical plans and migrations for comparison. Do not implement from these docs without explicitly updating the Golden Record.

## Legacy Domains (Curated)

- `unity/`: Unity 6 architecture, APIs, and migration notes (kept for parity review).
- `FEATURE_INVENTORY.md`: Consolidated legacy feature/UI/asset snapshot for parity checks.

## Usage Rules

- Treat legacy docs as **context only**.
- If a legacy idea is still valuable, migrate it into the appropriate `/docs/*` domain and note the move in `/docs/00-golden/DEPRECATIONS.md`.
