# Legacy Documentation (Reference Only)

**Purpose**: Preserve historical plans and migrations for comparison. Do not implement from these docs without explicitly updating the Golden Record.

## Legacy Domains

- `unity/`: Unity 6 architecture, APIs, and migration notes.
- `react/`: React/Reactylon migration plans and component promotion notes.
- `mobile/`: Deprecated mobile-native strategy.
- `procedural/`: Earlier procedural drafts superseded by current scene pipeline.
- `process/`: Historical handoffs, audits, and changelogs.
- `story/`: Deprecated narrative transformations.
- `testing/`: Legacy test plans and checklists.
- `assets/`: Historical asset status snapshots.
- `tech/`: Technical explorations and experiments.

## Usage Rules

- Treat legacy docs as **context only**.
- If a legacy idea is still valuable, migrate it into the appropriate `/docs/*` domain and note the move in `/docs/00-golden/DEPRECATIONS.md`.
