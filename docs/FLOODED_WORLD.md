# Flooded Neo-Tokyo: World Design Document v1.0

**Date**: January 19, 2026
**Purpose**: Definitive world-building guide for the flooded Neo-Tokyo setting

---

## The Catastrophe

Forty years ago, Neo-Tokyo flooded. Not a single catastrophic event, but a slow drowning - sea levels rising, typhoons intensifying, the ancient drainage systems failing. The city's lower floors filled first. Then the streets. Then the first stories. Then the second.

Today, the waterline sits at the **fourth floor** of most buildings.

The old city exists only as shadows beneath dark, polluted water. Occasionally, a rooftop antenna breaks the surface - a grave marker for what lies below.

## The World Above Water

### Rooftop Territory System

Life happens on rooftops now. Each rooftop is a **territory** - claimed, defended, connected to others by bridges and boats.

**Territory Types:**

| Type | Description | Characteristics |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Academy** | Youth training communities | Solar panels, training grounds, dormitory shelters |
| **Market** | Trading hubs | Salvage stalls, boat docks, crowded platforms |
| **Refuge** | Residential clusters | Makeshift housing, water collectors, gardens |
| **Factory** | Production facilities | Workshops, generators, salvage processing |
| **Ruin** | Abandoned/contested | Collapsed sections, dangerous, valuable salvage |
| **Shrine** | Sacred spaces | Preserved temples, community gathering, neutral ground |

### Vertical Layers

Instead of "strata," we have **water-relative zones:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  CANOPY (antennas, solar farms) │  +20m above waterline
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  ROOFTOP (main living space)    │  +5m to +15m
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  WATERLINE (docks, boats)       │  0m (sea level)
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  SHALLOWS (flooded upper floors)│  -1m to -5m
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  DEEP (old city, dangerous)     │  -5m and below
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Navigation & Transit

### Bridges
- **Plank Bridges**: Salvaged wood, rope railings, narrow
- **Scaffold Bridges**: Metal framework, wider, more permanent
- **Cable Cars**: Suspended baskets between tall buildings
- **Zip Lines**: Quick descent routes

### Watercraft
- **Skiffs**: Small personal boats, paddle or small motor
- **Ferries**: Larger craft connecting distant territories
- **Salvage Barges**: Work boats with cranes for underwater retrieval
- **Academy Boats**: Marked vessels for rival academy patrols

---

## The Rival Academies

In this world, academies aren't schools - they're **survival communities** that train youth in essential skills.

### Kurenai Academy ("Crimson Dawn")

**Philosophy**: "Passion burns brighter than fear"

- **Location**: Eastern rooftop cluster, built around an old hospital
- **Specialty**: Combat, athletics, direct action
- **Resources**: Salvage expertise, physical strength
- **Architecture**: Red tarps, exposed metal, training platforms
- **Leadership**: Elder council of survivors

### Azure Academy ("Still Water")

**Philosophy**: "Adapt or drown"

- **Location**: Western cluster, centered on old university buildings
- **Specialty**: Navigation, engineering, strategy
- **Resources**: Technical knowledge, boat-building
- **Architecture**: Blue canopies, organized layouts, workshops
- **Leadership**: Merit-based council

### Neutral Territories

- **The Market Collective**: Trading hub, neutral ground enforced
- **Shrine District**: Old temple rooftops, sacred peace
- **The Reach**: Contested outer territories, lawless

## Procedural Generation Rules

### Territory Generation (Dagster-style Factories)

```typescript
// Territory Definition (DDL-style)
interface TerritoryDefinition {
  type: TerritoryType;
  size: "small" | "medium" | "large";
  height: number; // meters above waterline
  features: FeatureDefinition[];
  connections: ConnectionDefinition[];
}

// Factory Pattern
const TerritoryFactory = {
  academy: (seed: string, faction: Faction) => TerritoryDefinition,
  market: (seed: string, size: Size) => TerritoryDefinition,
  refuge: (seed: string, population: number) => TerritoryDefinition,
  ruin: (seed: string, danger: number) => TerritoryDefinition,
};
```

### Feature Definitions (Asset DDL)

```typescript
// Shelter definitions
const ShelterDDL = {
  tarp_lean_to: { materials: ["tarp", "rope", "pole"], size: [2, 2, 2] },
  container_home: { materials: ["shipping_container"], size: [6, 2.5, 2.5] },
  platform_dwelling: { materials: ["wood", "metal", "tarp"], size: [4, 3, 4] },
};

// Bridge definitions
const BridgeDDL = {
  plank_bridge: { width: 1, supports: "rope", surface: "wood_planks" },
  scaffold_bridge: { width: 2, supports: "metal_frame", surface: "grating" },
  cable_bridge: { width: 1.5, supports: "cable", surface: "wood_planks" },
};
```

### Connection Generation

```typescript
// Bridge placement rules
const BridgeRules = {
  maxSpan: 30,  // meters
  minHeight: 3, // meters above water
  mustConnect: ["academy", "market"], // required routes
  avoidOver: ["deep_water", "contested"], // dangerous areas
};
```

---

## World Seeds

### Master Seed Structure

```
masterSeed = "neo-tokyo-flooded-{version}-{variant}"

From masterSeed derive:
  - territorySeeds[] (rooftop cluster layouts)
  - connectionSeeds[] (bridge/boat route patterns)
  - factionSeeds[] (academy territory distribution)
  - eventSeeds[] (weather, encounters, salvage)
```

### Reproducibility

All procedural elements derive deterministically from seeds:
- Same seed = same world
- Share seeds to share experiences
- Test with known seeds for debugging

---

## Integration with Gameplay

### Quest Integration

| Quest Type | Flooded World Context |
|------------|----------------------|
| **Fetch** | Salvage retrieval, dangerous dives |
| **Escort** | Guide boat through contested waters |
| **Combat** | Territory defense, pirate raid |
| **Mystery** | Investigate submerged ruins |
| **Diplomacy** | Negotiate bridge rights, trade deals |

### Combat Arenas

## What This World Is NOT

To maintain thematic coherence, we explicitly avoid:

- **Neon lights** - Power is scarce, displays are wasteful
- **Corporate towers** - Old world is underwater
- **Underground levels** - Flooded, inaccessible
- **Clean technology** - Everything is salvaged, repaired
- **Abundance** - Resources are contested, precious
- **Cyberpunk chrome** - This is post-apocalypse, not high-tech

*"The city drowned, but we learned to swim. The old world sank, but we built bridges. In the water's reflection, we see who we've become."*
