# World Geography: Rooftop Neo-Tokyo

**Date**: January 27, 2026
**Purpose**: Define the physical play space for the 3-hour story (single-city scope).

---

## Scope (Current Game)

The game takes place **entirely within Neo-Tokyo's rooftop districts**. We do **not** travel between multiple cities in the core 3-hour story. Other cities and regions are lore only.

---

## Rooftop District Map (Canonical)

Each district is a **story anchor** with procedural scenes layered on top.

| District | Role | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| **Kurenai Academy** | Protagonist home | Training platforms, red tarps, hospital rooftops |
| **Azure Academy** | Rival home | University rooftops, blue canopies, workshops |
| **Market Collective** | Neutral hub | Docks, stalls, barter economy |
| **Shrine District** | Sacred neutral ground | Old temple rooftops, no-fighting rule |
| **The Reach** | Contested edge | Lawless spans, pirate pressure |
| **Salvage Yards** | Resource zone | Crane barges, scrap piles |
| **Dockline** | Waterline transit | Skiffs, ferries, boat traffic |
| **Overlook** | High ground | Antennas, wind exposure |
| **Flooded Cut** | Story-critical descent | Entry into shallow/deep zones |

---

## Travel & Connectivity

### Primary Routes
- **Bridges**: short hops between adjacent rooftops.
- **Boat lanes**: connect Dockline <-> Market <-> Salvage Yards.
- **Cable lines**: fast traversal in storms or combat beats.

### Typical Travel Time (In-Game)
- Rooftop-to-rooftop: **2-5 minutes**
- District-to-district: **5-12 minutes**
- Dockline boat hop: **3-8 minutes**

---

## Information & Communication (Local Scale)

- **Runners**: most reliable comms; physical message delivery.
- **Radio**: rare; Academy and Syndicate only.
- **Signal Lights**: emergency-only, limited vocabulary.

---

## Social Structure (Neo-Tokyo)

- **Academies**: Kurenai and Azure control high ground and training territory.
- **Collective**: market governance and trade regulation.
- **Syndicate**: waterline control, smuggling, black market.
- **Drowned**: deep-zone cult; spiritual authority below.

---

## Outside World (Lore-Only)

Other cities (Neo-Yokohama, Neo-Kawasaki, Chiba Ruins, Mountain Refuge) exist **only as rumors** in the base game. They do not appear as locations in the 3-hour story.

---

## Future Expansion (Optional)

If expansion content is approved, these are the canonical candidates:
- **Neo-Yokohama**: industrial shipyards
- **Neo-Kawasaki**: contested transit corridor
- **Chiba Ruins**: toxic salvage zone
- **Mountain Refuge**: dry-land agriculture
