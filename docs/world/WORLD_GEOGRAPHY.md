# World Geography: The Flooded Kanto Archipelago

**Date**: January 19, 2026
**Purpose**: Define the physical world, inter-city connections, and societal structure
**Scope**: Multi-city game world inspired by Daggerfall's scale

---

## The Flood Event

### What Happened

Forty years before the game begins, sea levels rose catastrophically. The exact cause is debated:
- **Official Academy version**: Climate change accelerated by corporate negligence
- **Syndicate version**: Government weather experiment gone wrong
- **Drowned Cult version**: The ocean reclaiming what was always hers
- **Runner version**: Does it matter? We adapt or we drown.

### The Kanto Plain Reality

The Kanto Plain—home to Tokyo, Yokohama, Kawasaki, and surrounding cities—is among the flattest, lowest-elevation regions in Japan.

**Pre-flood elevations:**
- Central Tokyo: 0-40 meters above sea level
- Tokyo Bay coastline: 0-5 meters
- Yokohama: 0-30 meters
- Western suburbs: 30-100 meters
- Mountain foothills: 100+ meters

**With +50 meter sea rise:**
- Everything below 50m elevation: underwater
- Only tall buildings (15+ stories) have rooftops above water
- Mountain regions become "dry land" islands
- Tokyo Bay expands to consume most of the plain

## The Five Cities

### 1. Neo-Tokyo (Central Hub)

**Population**: ~50,000 survivors
**Elevation**: Rooftops 50-200m above new sea level
**Character**: Dense, vertical, politically fractured

The heart of the old capital. Skyscrapers pierce the water, their lower floors drowned, upper floors converted to vertical villages. The highest buildings house the Academies, while the Syndicate controls the waterline territories.

**Key Features:**
- Shinjuku Towers: Academy headquarters (Kurenai at Metropolitan Government Building)
- Shibuya Crossing: Now a massive floating market (Collective controlled)
- Tokyo Tower: Partially collapsed, sacred to the Drowned
- Ginza Canal: Syndicate gambling district, neon still burns here
- Akihabara Ruins: Salvage zone, dangerous but valuable tech

**Faction Control:**
- Academy: 25% (high ground)
- Syndicate: 30% (waterline, commerce)
- Collective: 25% (markets, mid-level)
- Refuge: 15% (scattered settlements)
- Drowned: 5% (submerged shrines)

---

### 2. Neo-Yokohama (Industrial South)

**Population**: ~30,000 survivors
**Elevation**: Rooftops 40-150m above sea level
**Character**: Industrial, shipbuilding, rough

The old port city. Yokohama's industrial heritage means more warehouses, more salvageable ships, more raw materials. But also more pollution, more danger, more desperate people.

**Key Features:**
- Minato Mirai Docks: Largest functioning shipyard
- Chinatown Rafts: Floating market, independent traders
- Landmark Tower: Regional broadcasting, contested
- Container City: Stacked shipping containers, Collective stronghold
- Red Brick Warehouse: Syndicate headquarters

**Faction Control:**
- Syndicate: 40% (port control = power)
- Collective: 30% (trade routes)
- Runners: 15% (ferry operations)
- Refuge: 10%
- Academy: 5% (small outpost)

---

### 3. Neo-Kawasaki (The Contested Middle)

**Population**: ~20,000 survivors
**Elevation**: Rooftops 45-120m above sea level
**Character**: Wartorn, strategic, dangerous

Between Tokyo and Yokohama, Kawasaki is eternally contested. Control the crossing, control trade. No faction has held it for long.

**Key Features:**
- Industrial Spine: Old factories, now fortress-markets
- Bridge Battles: Three major bridge chokepoints
- Lazona Stronghold: Massive mall complex, current Collective hold
- Tower Complex: Mixed housing, neutral ground (barely)
- Refinery Ruins: Dangerous but fuel can still be extracted

**Faction Control:**
- Contested (shifts monthly)
- Currently: Collective 35%, Syndicate 35%, Others 30%

---

### 4. Chiba Ruins (Eastern Danger Zone)

**Population**: ~10,000 survivors (estimated)
**Elevation**: Rooftops 30-80m above sea level
**Character**: Lawless, dangerous, treasure trove

Chiba took the flood worst. Lower elevation, more industrial pollution, less organized evacuation. Now it's a scavenger's paradise and a murderer's playground.

**Key Features:**
- Makuhari Ruins: Old convention center, massive salvage
- Port Tower: Collapsed, marks the "safe" boundary
- Chemical District: Toxic, mutated wildlife, valuable pharmaceuticals
- Disneyland Wreck: Drowned territory, cult significance
- Airport Island: Narita approach, mostly submerged, aircraft salvage

**Faction Control:**
- Drowned: 30% (they thrive here)
- Independent raiders: 40%
- Salvage crews (mixed): 20%
- No major faction control: too dangerous

---

### 5. Mountain Refuge (Northern Dry Land)

**Population**: ~15,000 survivors
**Elevation**: 200-500m above sea level (actual dry land)
**Character**: Agricultural, isolationist, suspicious

The mountains west and north of Tokyo remained above water. Here, actual farming is possible. Actual animals exist. It's almost pre-flood normal—and they want to keep it that way.

**Key Features:**
- Okutama Valley: Agricultural communes
- Takao Settlement: Largest dry-land town
- Mountain Pass: Only land route, heavily guarded
- Monastery Compounds: Buddhist temples turned fortresses
- Refugee Camps: Those who couldn't integrate, living rough

**Faction Control:**
- Local councils: 60% (not aligned with city factions)
- Refuge: 25% (officially affiliated)
- Academy: 10% (research outpost)
- Syndicate: 5% (black market access)

## Inter-City Travel

### The Ferry Network

Travel between cities is by water. The old highways are underwater, old rail lines corroded. Only boats work.

```
FERRY ROUTES:

Neo-Tokyo ←─────────→ Neo-Yokohama
   │  (4 hours)              │
   │                         │
   │ (2 hours)               │ (3 hours)
   │                         │
   ↓                         ↓
Neo-Kawasaki ←─────────→ Neo-Yokohama
       │   (2 hours)
       │
       │ (6 hours, dangerous)
       ↓
Chiba Ruins

Mountain Refuge: No direct water access
  └── Accessed via Okutama River (shallow draft boats)
  └── Or overland from western Tokyo rooftops
```

### Ferry Types

| Type | Capacity | Speed | Safety | Operator |
|------|----------|-------|--------|----------|
| Runner Skiff | 2-4 | Fast | Low | Independent |
| Ferry Barge | 20-50 | Slow | Medium | Collective |
| Syndicate Cruiser | 10-20 | Medium | High | Syndicate |
| Academy Transport | 30-50 | Medium | High | Academy |
| Salvage Tug | 5-10 | Slow | Medium | Mixed |

### Travel Hazards

**Weather**: Typhoons still hit. Travel stops for days.
**Pirates**: Particularly near Kawasaki and Chiba routes.
**Drowned**: They consider certain waters sacred. Trespassers vanish.
**Debris**: Floating wreckage, unpredictable currents.
**Fuel**: Boats need fuel. Fuel is rare. Sometimes you row.

## Information & Communication

### What Do People Know?

**Local (Certain)**:
- Your settlement, your neighbors
- Trade routes you've personally traveled
- Faction territories in your city

**Regional (Rumored)**:
- Other cities exist, specific details vary
- Rough population estimates
- Which factions control what (changes constantly)
- General hazard zones

**Distant (Mythologized)**:
- The Mountain Refuge (paradise? prison?)
- Other countries (did they survive?)
- The cause of the flood (everyone has a theory)
- Pre-flood technology (exaggerated capabilities)

### Communication Methods

**Radio** (rare, requires power):
- Academy maintains limited broadcasts
- Syndicate has encrypted channels
- Mountain Refuge has the strongest signal
- Most people can't afford receivers

**Runners** (common):
- Human messengers carrying information
- The Runners faction specializes in this
- Information as currency
- News is always days or weeks old

**Signal Fires/Lights** (emergency):
- Tower-to-tower visual signals
- Limited vocabulary (attack, help, all-clear)
- Weather dependent

**Written Messages** (trusted):
- Physical letters carried by travelers
- Sealed with faction marks
- Literacy not universal

### Information Economy

| Information Type | Value | Source |
|------------------|-------|--------|
| Ferry schedules | Low | Public knowledge |
| Faction movements | Medium | Runner intelligence |
| Salvage locations | High | Dangerous to acquire |
| Pre-flood tech manuals | Very High | Rare salvage |
| Mountain Refuge routes | Extremely High | Closely guarded |
| Outside world news | Priceless | Unverified, possibly false |

## Society Structure

### The Day/Night Divide

Most survivors live **pre-industrial** lives:

**Day** (productive hours):
- Fishing, aquafarming
- Trading, market activity
- Construction, repair
- Travel (safer in daylight)

**Night** (dangerous hours):
- Stay inside
- Fire/lantern light only
- Increased crime
- Drowned are more active

**Exception**: Syndicate territories have power. Night is when their world comes alive—neon signs, electric lights, gambling, vice. It's an alien experience for most.

### Class Structure

```
SOCIAL HIERARCHY:

ELITE (5%):
├── Academy Leadership
├── Syndicate Bosses
└── Mountain Council
    Features: Electricity, meat, security, knowledge

CONNECTED (15%):
├── Faction members (not leadership)
├── Skilled traders
└── Technical specialists
    Features: Stable food, some comforts, protection

SURVIVING (60%):
├── Collective members
├── Independent fishers
└── General laborers
    Features: Fish protein, shelter, basic safety

DESPERATE (20%):
├── Refugees (new arrivals)
├── Failed settlements
└── Outcasts
    Features: Uncertain food, temporary shelter, high danger
```

### Prestige Markers

How do you know someone is powerful?

| Marker | Rarity | What It Signals |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Electric light at night | Rare | Syndicate/Academy connection |
| Chicken eggs | Uncommon | Established settlement |
| Dog companion | Very rare | Serious resources |
| Neon sign | Rare | Criminal wealth |
| Clean clothes | Uncommon | Access to fresh water |
| Metal weapons | Common | Basic competence |
| Pre-flood tech | Rare | Technical skill or salvage luck |
| Goat/livestock | Extremely rare | Leadership level resources |
| Horse | Nearly mythical | Legendary status |

## The Outside World

### What Survivors Believe

**Optimistic view**:
- Japan was hit hardest; other nations recovered
- Rescue ships will come eventually
- The Mountain Refuge has contact with outside

**Pessimistic view**:
- The whole world flooded
- Japan's islands are all that's left
- There is no "outside" anymore

**Drowned view**:
- The ocean took what it wanted
- The land that remains is sacred
- Trying to leave is blasphemy

### Actual Status (Unknown to Characters)

*(This is worldbuilding for writers, not revealed to players)*

The flood was global but uneven:
- Coastal cities worldwide: devastated
- Inland/elevated regions: surviving
- Island nations (Japan, Indonesia, Philippines): worst hit
- Continental interiors: largely intact but isolated

International communication collapsed:
- Undersea cables flooded
- Satellites degraded without maintenance
- Radio exists but range is limited
- No one knows the full picture

Occasional contact:
- Ships from Korea (rare, dangerous journey)
- Rumors of Chinese expeditions
- Nothing confirmed

**Player Experience**: The mystery should remain. Are they alone? Is rescue coming? The uncertainty is the point.
