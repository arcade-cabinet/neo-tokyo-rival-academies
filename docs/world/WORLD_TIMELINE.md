# Flooded World: Timeline & Backstory

**Date**: January 19, 2026
**Purpose**: Canonical timeline establishing design anchors for the Flooded World setting

---

## Design Anchor Principle

Like Fallout anchors its "pre-war" aesthetic to 1950s Atomic Age culture, **Flooded World anchors to the 2020s-2030s** - our current era. This means:

- Pre-flood technology looks like **today's tech** (smartphones, modern interfaces, contemporary design)
- Pre-flood infrastructure uses **current typography and signage** (clean sans-serifs, digital-native design)
- The "old world" artifacts players find should feel **familiar, recent, relatable**
- This makes the loss more poignant - it's OUR world that drowned

**Typography Anchor**: Technical Precision (Rajdhani + Inter) - modern, digital-native, what would appear on 2030s infrastructure and devices.

## Timeline

### The Old World (Before Year 0)

#### 2020s - The Warning Signs
- Global sea levels rising faster than predicted
- Tokyo experiences record typhoon seasons
- "Once in a century" floods become annual events
- Infrastructure strain becomes visible - drainage systems overwhelmed
- Climate refugees from Pacific islands arrive in Japan
- Government debates seawall expansion but funding stalls

#### 2030-2035 - The Acceleration
- **2030**: Tokyo Bay seawall breach during Typhoon Yuki - 12 districts flooded for weeks
- **2032**: "Permanent flood zones" officially designated in low-lying areas
- First "elevated communities" built - wealthy districts raise infrastructure
- Economic divide sharpens between elevated and ground-level residents
- Youth migration to rooftops begins organically - squatters, artists, outcasts

#### 2035-2038 - The Cascade
- **2035**: Greenland ice sheet collapse triggers acceleration
- **2036**: Government announces "Strategic Retreat" - official abandonment of lower floors
- Mass migration to upper floors and rooftops
- Power grid failures become common - solar becomes necessity
- First "rooftop markets" emerge as official commerce collapses
- Street-level crime surges, then becomes irrelevant as streets flood

#### Year 0 - The Drowning (2038)
- **Spring 2038**: Typhoon Megumi - the largest recorded storm
- Storm surge + high tide + infrastructure failure = catastrophic flooding
- 72-hour event that never fully receded
- Official government communication ceases after Day 3
- No single moment of collapse - just a threshold crossed
- When waters stabilized, the waterline sat at the 4th floor

This is **Year 0** of the new calendar.

### The Flood Years (Year 0 - Year 10)

#### Year 0-1 - Chaos
- Rooftop communities isolated, no central authority
- Violence over resources - "the hungry year"
- Many die from contaminated water, exposure, violence
- Survivors learn who can be trusted
- First bridges built between adjacent rooftops
- "Salvage diving" emerges as essential skill

#### Year 2-5 - Tribal Formation
- Rooftop clusters coalesce into proto-communities
- Stronger communities absorb or push out weaker ones
- Trade routes establish between clusters
- "Clean water = currency" economy emerges
- First generation of flood-born children
- Adults who remember the old world become "Elders"

#### Year 5-10 - The Academies Form
- Elders realize: children need structure, skills, purpose
- **Year 6**: Kurenai Academy founded around Higashi Hospital rooftop
  - Founded by former firefighters, athletes, emergency responders
  - Philosophy: "Passion burns brighter than fear" - action, courage, direct solutions
  - Red tarps become signature (salvaged from emergency supplies)

- **Year 7**: Azure Academy founded around Tokyo University rooftops
  - Founded by engineers, professors, strategists
  - Philosophy: "Adapt or drown" - logic, planning, sustainable solutions
  - Blue canopies from university awnings become signature

- **Year 8-10**: Territory disputes, first "academy wars"
- Neutral zones established (markets, shrines)
- "The Reach" becomes contested outer territory

---

### The Middle Years (Year 10 - Year 30)

#### Year 10-15 - Stabilization
- Population stabilizes (birth rate matches death rate)
- Sustainable food sources developed (fishing, rooftop gardens, algae farms)
- Water filtration technology standardized
- Solar panel salvage becomes critical industry
- First children who never knew the old world reach adulthood
- "Waterline generation" - flood-born adults take leadership roles

#### Year 15-20 - Cultural Development
- Oral histories formalized - Elders record memories
- New festivals emerge (Remembrance Day, Storm Watch, First Bridge Day)
- Academy rivalries become ritualized - less violence, more competition
- Art emerges - murals, music, storytelling about the flood
- "Data shards" - old phones/tablets with pre-flood content become treasured
- Religion adapts - shrines become neutral community centers

#### Year 20-30 - The New Normal
- Third generation born (no living memory of old world)
- Elders dying off - first-hand accounts becoming rare
- Pre-flood artifacts increasingly valuable/mythologized
- Academy system fully mature - structured education, ranks, traditions
- Trade networks span the flooded city
- "The Deep" becomes forbidden/legendary - dangerous salvage territory

---

### The Current Era (Year 30 - Year 40)

#### Year 30-35 - Tensions Rise
- Resources becoming scarcer - easy salvage exhausted
- Pressure to dive deeper into dangerous zones
- Academy rivalry intensifies as territory disputes increase
- "Tide Runners" - pirates/raiders - become organized threat
- Weather patterns shifting again - are things getting worse?

#### Year 35-40 - Present Day (Game Setting)
- **Year 40**: The game takes place here
- Player character is ~17 years old (born Year 23, third generation)
- Parents were "waterline generation" - born during flood years
- Grandparents (if alive) are Elders - last people with old world memories
- Tensions between academies at all-time high
- Rumors of "something below" - old world tech, dangers, secrets
- Climate showing signs of further change - new storms, shifting tides

## Generational Demographics

| Generation | Birth Years | Age in Year 40 | Characteristics |
|------------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Elders** | Pre-flood | 55+ | Remember old world, dying out, revered |
| **Survivors** | Year -10 to 0 | 40-55 | Childhood in old world, trauma, pragmatic |
| **Waterline** | Year 0-15 | 25-40 | Born during chaos, adaptable, tough |
| **Flood-Born** | Year 15-30 | 10-25 | No memory of old world, this IS normal |
| **Current Youth** | Year 30+ | Under 10 | Fourth generation, old world is myth |

**Player Character**: Flood-Born generation, late teens

## Design Implications

### What Pre-Flood Artifacts Look Like
- **Smartphones/tablets**: Modern touch interfaces, cracked screens, dead batteries
- **Signage**: Clean sans-serif fonts (Inter, Roboto, SF Pro equivalents)
- **Vehicles**: Recognizable cars, mostly submerged, some salvaged parts
- **Buildings**: Contemporary architecture, glass and steel, now weathered
- **Technology**: USB-C, solar panels, LED lighting, familiar interfaces

### What Post-Flood Culture Created
- **Handmade signage**: Painted, stenciled, functional
- **Salvage aesthetic**: Patched, repaired, mismatched
- **New traditions**: Festivals, rituals, oral histories
- **Practical innovation**: Water filters, rope bridges, solar rigs
- **Academy identity**: Colors, symbols, philosophies

### Typography in Context
- **Pre-flood signs**: Rajdhani-style technical fonts (found on salvaged equipment)
- **Post-flood signs**: Cruder, hand-painted, but influenced by what people remember
- **UI (player interface)**: Modern style - represents player's personal device/HUD
- **In-world UI**: Salvaged screens showing old-world interfaces

## Unanswered Questions (Story Hooks)

- What happened to the government? Did they evacuate? Hide? Die?
- Are there other survivor communities beyond the city?
- What's in the deepest parts of the old city?
- Is the flooding still getting worse?
- Who/what are the "voices" some divers report hearing?
- Did anyone cause or accelerate the flood?
- Are the Academies hiding something about their founding?

## Relationship to Old Narrative Docs

**NARRATIVE_DESIGN.md** and **STORY_ARCS.md** contain the OLD cyberpunk setting (Midnight Exam, neon streets, etc.) and should be considered **DEPRECATED**.

The core character dynamics (Kai vs Vera, Academy rivalry) can be adapted:
- "Midnight Exam" race → Territory/salvage competition
- Neon streets → Rooftop bridges
- Cyberpunk chrome → Salvage tech
- Corporate conspiracy → Academy secrets

A new narrative document should be created that adapts these story beats to the Flooded World setting.

*"Forty years ago, the city drowned. The waters rose and never fell. But we learned to swim. We learned to build. We learned that home isn't a place - it's the people you survive with."*
