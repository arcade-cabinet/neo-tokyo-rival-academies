# Flooded Neo-Tokyo: World Design Document v1.0

**Date**: January 19, 2026
**Updated**: January 27, 2026
**Purpose**: Definitive world-building guide for the flooded Neo-Tokyo setting

---
## The Catastrophe

Forty years ago, Neo-Tokyo flooded. Not a single catastrophic event, but a slow drowning - sea levels rising, typhoons intensifying, the ancient drainage systems failing. The city's lower floors filled first. Then the streets. Then the first stories. Then the second.

Today, the waterline sits at the **fourth floor** of most buildings.

The old city exists only as shadows beneath dark, polluted water. Occasionally, a rooftop antenna breaks the surface - a grave marker for what lies below.

## The World Above Water

### Rooftop Territory System

Life happens on rooftops now. Each rooftop is a **territory** - claimed, defended, connected to others by bridges and boats.

**Territory Types:**

| Type | Description | Characteristics |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Academy** | Youth training communities | Solar panels, training grounds, dormitory shelters |
| **Market** | Trading hubs | Salvage stalls, boat docks, crowded platforms |
| **Refuge** | Residential clusters | Makeshift housing, water collectors, gardens |
| **Factory** | Production facilities | Workshops, generators, salvage processing |
| **Ruin** | Abandoned/contested | Collapsed sections, dangerous, valuable salvage |
| **Shrine** | Sacred spaces | Preserved temples, community gathering, neutral ground |

### Vertical Layers

Instead of "strata," we have **water-relative zones:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  CANOPY (antennas, solar farms) │  +20m above waterline
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  ROOFTOP (main living space)    │  +5m to +15m
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  WATERLINE (docks, boats)       │  0m (sea level)
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  SHALLOWS (flooded upper floors)│  -1m to -5m
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  DEEP (old city, dangerous)     │  -5m and below
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

## The Rival Academies

In this world, academies aren't schools - they're **survival communities** that train youth in essential skills.

### Kurenai Academy ("Crimson Dawn")

**Philosophy**: "Passion burns brighter than fear"

- **Location**: Eastern rooftop cluster, built around an old hospital
- **Specialty**: Combat, athletics, direct action
- **Resources**: Salvage expertise, physical strength
- **Architecture**: Red tarps, exposed metal, training platforms
- **Leadership**: Elder council of survivors

### Azure Academy ("Still Water")

**Philosophy**: "Adapt or drown"

- **Location**: Western cluster, centered on old university buildings
- **Specialty**: Navigation, engineering, strategy
- **Resources**: Technical knowledge, boat-building
- **Architecture**: Blue canopies, organized layouts, workshops
- **Leadership**: Merit-based council

### Neutral Territories

- **The Market Collective**: Trading hub, neutral ground enforced
- **Shrine District**: Old temple rooftops, sacred peace
- **The Reach**: Contested outer territories, lawless

## Geography & Districts

### Scope (Current Game)
The base game takes place **entirely within Neo-Tokyo's rooftop districts**. There is **no inter-city travel** in the 3-hour story. Other locations exist only as lore.

### Rooftop District Map (Canonical)
Each district is a **story anchor** with procedural scenes layered on top.

| District | Role | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| **Kurenai Academy** | Protagonist home | Training platforms, red tarps, hospital rooftops |
| **Azure Academy** | Rival home | University rooftops, blue canopies, workshops |
| **Market Collective** | Neutral hub | Docks, stalls, barter economy |
| **Shrine District** | Sacred neutral ground | Old temple rooftops, no-fighting rule |
| **The Reach** | Contested edge | Lawless spans, pirate pressure |
| **Salvage Yards** | Resource zone | Crane barges, scrap piles |
| **Dockline** | Waterline transit | Skiffs, ferries, boat traffic |
| **Overlook** | High ground | Antennas, wind exposure |
| **Flooded Cut** | Story-critical descent | Entry into shallow/deep zones |

### Travel & Connectivity
- **Bridges**: Short hops between adjacent rooftops.
- **Boat lanes**: Dockline ↔ Market ↔ Salvage Yards.
- **Cable lines**: Fast traversal in storms or combat beats.

**Typical Travel Times (In-Game)**
- Rooftop-to-rooftop: **2-5 minutes**
- District-to-district: **5-12 minutes**
- Dockline boat hop: **3-8 minutes**

### Communication (Local Scale)
- **Runners**: Physical message delivery, most reliable.
- **Radio**: Rare; Academy + Syndicate only.
- **Signal lights**: Emergency-only, limited vocabulary.

### Outside World (Lore-Only)
Other cities (Neo-Yokohama, Neo-Kawasaki, Chiba Ruins, Mountain Refuge) are **rumors only** in the base game.

### Future Expansion (Optional)
If expansions are approved, these are the canonical candidates:
- **Neo-Yokohama**: industrial shipyards
- **Neo-Kawasaki**: contested transit corridor
- **Chiba Ruins**: toxic salvage zone
- **Mountain Refuge**: dry-land agriculture

## Timeline & Backstory

### Design Anchor Principle
Pre-flood culture anchors to the **2020s-2030s** (our current era). Artifacts should feel familiar and recent.

- **Pre-flood tech**: modern phones, clean sans-serif signage, contemporary interfaces.
- **Old-world UI**: technical precision, modern digital typography.
- **Post-flood UI**: hand-painted signage inspired by what people remember.

### The Old World (Before Year 0)
- **2020s**: sea levels rise, typhoons intensify, drainage fails.
- **2030-2035**: seawall breach, flood zones declared, rooftop migration begins.
- **2035-2038**: mass retreat to rooftops, grid instability, solar becomes essential.
- **Year 0 (2038)**: Typhoon Megumi triggers the permanent drowning; water stabilizes at the 4th floor.

### Flood Years (Year 0-10)
- **Year 0-1**: chaos, resource violence, first bridges.
- **Year 2-5**: trade routes, water-as-currency economy.
- **Year 6-7**: Kurenai and Azure Academies founded.
- **Year 8-10**: first academy conflicts; markets and shrines declared neutral.

### Middle Years (Year 10-30)
- Stabilized population, rooftop farming, standardized filtration.
- Rivalries become ritualized; oral histories formalize.
- The Deep becomes forbidden, mythologized.

### Present Day (Year 35-40)
- Resources tighten, academy tension peaks.
- Pirates organize; storms intensify again.
- **Year 40**: game begins.

### Generational Demographics
| Generation | Birth Years | Age in Year 40 | Characteristics |
|------------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Elders** | Pre-flood | 55+ | Remember old world, dying out |
| **Survivors** | Year -10 to 0 | 40-55 | Trauma, pragmatic |
| **Waterline** | Year 0-15 | 25-40 | Born during chaos, tough |
| **Flood-Born** | Year 15-30 | 10-25 | Old world is myth |
| **Current Youth** | Year 30+ | Under 10 | Fourth generation |

### Key Historical Events (Quest/Lore Anchors)
| Event | Year | Significance |
|------|------|--------------|
| Typhoon Yuki Breach | -8 | First major warning |
| Strategic Retreat | -2 | Official abandonment |
| The Drowning | 0 | 72 hours that changed everything |
| The Hungry Year | 1 | Darkest period, highest casualties |
| First Bridge Built | 2 | Cooperation milestone |
| Kurenai Academy Founded | 6 | Eastern hospital rooftops |
| Azure Academy Founded | 7 | University rooftops |
| Treaty of Neutral Waters | 10 | Markets + shrines neutral |
| The Great Storm | 22 | Worst typhoon since Megumi |
| Present Day | 40 | Game begins |

### Open Questions (Hooks)
- What happened to the government?
- Who accelerated the flood (if anyone)?
- Are survivors still below the waterline?
- What is in the deepest ruins?

## What This World Is NOT

To maintain thematic coherence, we explicitly avoid:

- **Neon lights** - Power is scarce, displays are wasteful
- **Corporate towers** - Old world is underwater
- **Underground levels** - Flooded, inaccessible
- **Clean technology** - Everything is salvaged, repaired
- **Abundance** - Resources are contested, precious
- **Cyberpunk chrome** - This is post-apocalypse, not high-tech

*"The city drowned, but we learned to swim. The old world sank, but we built bridges. In the water's reflection, we see who we've become."*
