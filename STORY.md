# Neo-Tokyo: Rival Academies - Storyboard

## The World: Neo-Tokyo Sector 0
A sprawling, vertical metropolis built on the ruins of the old world. Neon lights clash with brutalist concrete. Rain is constant.

## The Conflict: The Midnight Exam
Every year, the two top academies compete in an illegal, high-speed parkour race across the skyline to claim the "Data Core" from the summit of the Orbital Elevator.

## The Factions

### 1. Kurenai Technical High (The Player)
*   **Philosophy:** "Ignition." Passion, brute force, overclocking, fire.
*   **Colors:** Crimson, Black, Gold.
*   **Prodigy:** **Kai "Spark" Takeda**.
    *   *Personality:* Hot-headed, loud, deeply loyal. "I'll smash through any wall!"
    *   **Weapon:** **The Redline Piston**. A massive, oversized pile-bunker/hammer powered by a V12 engine block. It smokes and vibrates constantly.

### 2. Azure Logic Institute (The Rival)
*   **Philosophy:** "Calculation." Precision, speed, optimizing, ice.
*   **Colors:** Cobalt, White, Silver.
*   **Prodigy:** **Vera "Vector" Kusanagi**.
    *   *Personality:* Cold, calculating, arrogant. "Your trajectory ends here."
    *   **Weapon:** **The Null Set**. A floating, geometric railgun lance that disassembles and reassembles itself.

## Narrative Flow (Cutscenes)

    *   **Kai:** "Hey Vector! Try not to overheat your processor keeping up with me!"
    *   **Vera:** "Your noise pollution is inefficient, Takeda. I have already calculated the victory path."
    *   **System:** "MIDNIGHT EXAM INITIATED. GO!"

### Scene 2: The Ambush (Distance > 500m)
*   **Action:** Game pauses. Vera drops from the sky in front of Kai.
